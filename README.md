Currently, I am majoring in Systems Analysis and Development, and in addition to college, I study programming online to continuously improve my skills. Before my first "Hello World," I did volunteer work and was involved in student leadership at my school. Today, I work at a Professional Training Center where I am coordinator, salesperson and instructor for the computing course.

In recent months, I have been studying Scrum, SEO strategies, and have set aside time to read the Clean Code book. I have also developed some personal projects to improve my Object-Oriented Programming skills.

I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, React, Node, MongoDB, and Git technologies, having been studying them for a little over a year. I have developed a personal project called NoteBit, which is a clone of the note-taking app, Evernote. Additionally, I have good teamwork skills, logical thinking, proactivity, and a great passion for learning new things.
